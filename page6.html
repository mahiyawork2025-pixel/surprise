<h1>🌙 A Du'a For You, <span id="greetName"></span></h1>

<div class="final-card">

<p>
This Ramadan is not just about fasting.
It is about becoming.
</p>

<p>
Becoming stronger in discipline.
Becoming softer in character.
Becoming steadier in faith.
Becoming the man Allah is shaping you into.
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p>
Allah says:
</p>

<p>
“And whoever relies upon Allah — then He is sufficient for him.”
— Qur’an 65:3
</p>

<p>
And:
</p>

<p>
“Our Lord, grant us from our spouses and offspring comfort to our eyes
and make us leaders for the righteous.”
— Qur’an 25:74
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p>
May Allah open for you doors of rizq you never imagined.
</p>

<p>
May He remove anxiety from your heart and replace it with tawakkul.
</p>

<p>
May He strengthen your salah, your discipline, your patience.
</p>

<p>
May He grant clarity in your career decisions.
</p>

<p>
May He write for us a future that is halal, peaceful, and full of barakah.
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p class="glow">
This Ramadan is not pressure.
It is preparation.
</p>

<p>
And I believe in the man you are becoming.
But more importantly,
Allah sees your effort — even when no one else does.
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p style="font-style:italic;">
“O Allah, bless him with guidance, provision, strength,
and a heart that never drifts from You.
Make him firm in faith and successful in both worlds.”
Ameen.
