  <p>
    “O you who believe, fasting has been prescribed upon you 
    as it was prescribed upon those before you, 
    that you may become righteous.”  
    — Qur’an 2:183
  </p>

  <p>
    My love, this month is not just about hunger and thirst.  
    It is about rebuilding yourself from the inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you worry about your career…  
    when you feel pressure about responsibility…  
    when you think about our future and whether you are “ready”…  
    remember:
  </p>

  <p>
    Allah is <strong>Ar-Razzaq</strong> — The Provider.  
    Allah is <strong>Al-Fattah</strong> — The Opener.  
    Allah is <strong>Al-Hakeem</strong> — The Most Wise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing meant for you will miss you.
    And nothing that misses you was ever written for you.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin:30px 0; opacity:0.3;">

  <p>
    The Prophet ﷺ said:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Whoever fasts Ramadan out of faith and hope for reward,
    his previous sins will be forgiven.”  
    — Sahih Bukhari & Muslim
  </p>

  <p>
    And he ﷺ also said:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Know that if the whole nation gathered together to benefit you,
    they would not benefit you except with what Allah had already written for you.”
    — Tirmidhi
  </p>

  <hr style="margin:30px 0; opacity:0.3;">

  <p>
    This is your month to:
  </p>

  <p>
    • Build discipline through fasting  
    • Build leadership through prayer  
    • Build clarity through Quran  
    • Build strength through patience  
  </p>

  <p>
    Career success is not just strategy.  
    It is barakah.
  </p>

  <p>
    Marriage is not just timing.  
    It is divine decree.
  </p>

  <p>
    And barakah comes from obedience.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin:30px 0; opacity:0.3;">

  <p>
    Allah says:
  </p>

  <p>
    “And whoever fears Allah — He will make for him a way out
    and provide for him from where he does not expect.”
    — Qur’an 65:2-3
  </p>

  <p>
    So this Ramadan, don’t chase outcomes.
    Chase Allah.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wake up for Tahajjud even if it’s two rak’ahs.
    Make quiet dua even if it’s one sentence.
    Improve 1% daily.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe in you.  
    But more importantly — Allah sees your effort.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin:30px 0; opacity:0.3;">

  <p style="font-style:italic; opacity:0.85;">
    May this Ramadan transform you into the man
    whose heart is calm, whose rizq is expanded,
    and whose future is written with goodness for us.
  </p>
